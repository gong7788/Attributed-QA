My MSc Project

The code under "atlas" and "langchain" are not my work.
The function "score_predictions", "normalize_text" and "compute_f1" in file "evaluation.py" are not my work. 
- there might have other helper functions that from the internet but can not fully remember.

All other codes that used for my project are my own work.
