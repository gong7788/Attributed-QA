DMV maintains a point system to track dangerous drivers.

The $300 DRA fee can be paid in $100 annual installments over three years. Motorists who fail to maintain an updated address with DMV may resolve their tickets with the court, but never receive their DRA assessment because we do not have their new address on record.

For more information about the Electronic Lien Transaction system , please see the Electronic Lien Transfer Program Business User Manual PDF ELT-1 [4].
