Better yet , don t visit a DMV office at all, and see if your transaction can be performed online, like an address change, registration renewal, license renewal, replacing a lost title, paying a DRA or scheduling a road test.

DMV maintains a point system to track dangerous drivers. Often , motorists convicted of a traffic ticket feel they have resolved all their motoring issues with the local court, but later learn that the Driver Responsibility Assessment DRA is a separate DMV charge based on the total points they accumulate. The $300 DRA fee can be paid in $100 annual installments over three years. Motorists who fail to maintain an updated address with DMV may resolve their tickets with the court, but never receive their DRA assessment because we do not have their new address on record. Failure to pay the DRA will result in a suspended license.

Here is an example to show how your refund amount is determined. You paid $137.50 to register your vehicle for two years. The amount you paid included $62.50 for the two years of the registration $31.25 per year, $50.00 for the title certificate and $25.00 for the vehicle plates. You surrender the vehicle plates during the first year of the registration , and you qualify for a refund of $30.25. This is a refund of the $31.25 fee for the second year of the registration with the $1 processing fee subtracted. There is no refund of other fees or taxes.
How can I get my refund (if I m eligible)? 
When you surrender your plates , your Receipt FS-6 T indicates if you are eligible to receive a refund. If you are eligible for a refund and you do not request a transfer receipt, we will process your refund automatically and you will receive it in the mail in several weeks. If you are not eligible for a refund or you request a transfer receipt , the DMV office issues a Receipt FS-6 T that you can use to transfer the registration to another vehicle.
How do I apply for a full 2-year refund if the registration was never used? 
You can apply for a refund of the 2-year registration fee ONLY if the registration was never used and it is not more than 60 days from the date the registration was issued. For example , if you renewed the registration, but never used the new registration sticker , you can apply for a refund of the 2-year fee that you paid when you renewed the registration. A processing fee of $1 is subtracted from the refund amount. The registration sticker cannot be used. If the sticker was attached to the windshield or the vehicle plate , you cannot remove the sticker and apply for a full refund. To apply for a full 2-year refund , you must surrender the vehicle plates and the unused registration sticker and stub at a DMV office and request a 2-year refund. If eligible for the refund , the DMV office will issue a receipt that displays "" two year refund.
