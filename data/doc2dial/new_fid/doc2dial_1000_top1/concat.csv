However , TVBs do not handle parking violations. If you plead not guilty to a traffic ticket in one of these TVB areas , your case will be heard by a DMV Administrative Law Judge ALJ, an experienced attorney with special training in the Vehicle and Traffic Law. An ALJ has the authority to decide whether or not you are guilty and to set a fine if you are found guilty.
